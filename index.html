      <p>Our founder, Dr. Jett Jackson, established this company as a way to help his peers make it in a competitive
        field. Dr. Jackson is very passionate about providing guidance to those in need of it, and decided that the best
        way to do that, was to allow others to work temporarily for his many companies, through a singular program. This
        is how Toolbox Trainers was originally founded, back in 1995.</p>
